# 🍎 Fruit Classification App

## 🧠 Overview
This is a **Fruit Classification Machine Learning app** built with Python and deployed using Streamlit.  
It takes an image of a fruit and predicts its type using a trained ML model. This is ideal for beginners who want to explore real-world ML pipeline and deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn (ML model training) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Streamlit (app UI)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional training process)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 💾 Dataset
The project uses a fruit image dataset containing different fruit classes. *(Mention where you got your dataset e.g., Kaggle link)*

Example dataset sources:
- Fruit 360 Dataset (link: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)

---

## 💡 How It Works
1. The **train_model.py** script trains a classification model using fruit images.  
2. The trained model is saved to the `model/` folder.  
3. **app.py** loads the saved model and builds a web interface where users upload images for prediction.
